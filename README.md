# simple-calculator
In this project, I've created a basic calculator using c++ language that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers entered by the user. It's a great exercise for beginners in C++ programming to understand basic concepts like variables, input/output, and decision-making using switch-case statements.

Here's a quick overview of how it works:

It prompts the user to enter two numbers.
Then, it asks the user to choose an operator (+, -, *, /).
Based on the operator selected, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
Finally, it displays the result to the user.
